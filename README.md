We all like to make personal goals. Lose weight. Eat healthy. Save money.
The problem is that most of us don't have anyone to keep us accountable.

BetterBet is peer-to-peer accountability system that gamifies the goal achievement process. Wanna prove to others that you can achieve your goal? Simply bet money against your accountability buddy. If you don't meet your goal, then your money goes to your friend. If you do meet your goal, and your accountability buddy confirms this, then the money is yours to keep.
